# Unix Soul

Unix Soul is a go to configuration tool that touches the soul of every unix (GNU/linux) user.

I will try to bring all the inspirations form r/unix... you know what I am talking about

> Can't wait tilll first release

## HOW It should work

```bash
unixsoul --cfg_dir=[path/to/config/dir]
unixsoul update 
```
> updates all the tools that are used in ricing may be we will use a unix_packages.json to keep record of all the packages that have been installed
